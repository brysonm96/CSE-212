# Trees

Trees are similar to linked list in the sense that it uses nodes and pointers to connect them. The difference is that trees
can connect to multiple different nodes. In computing, trees are used for sorting and searching, becuse they provide a hierarchal structure.
We will take a look at a few different types of trees, as well as some of their common operations.

## Binary Tree

A `Binary Tree` is a type of tree where each node can have up to two connections to other nodes.\
The highest node in the tree is called the `Root Node`.\
Nodes with connected nodes are called `Parent Nodes`.\
The node that is connected to the parent is known as a `Child Node`.\
Nodes without any connected nodes are called `Leaf Nodes`.\
The group of nodes on the left or right side of the parent node form a `Subtree`
