# Set Draft

The set data structure is different from other data structures such as stacks and queues, 
in the sense that the order of data does not matter; The data has no inherent position.
A key feature of sets is that they do not allow duplicate values. 
This means that any given value can appear in a set at most once. 

Sets are typically used when we need to keep track of a collection of items, but we don't care about their order or how many times each item appears. Some common use cases for sets include:

* Removing duplicates from a collection of items
* Checking whether an item is in a collection (membership testing)
* Performing set operations such as union, intersection, and difference
* Finding unique elements across multiple collections
