# Stacks

### Important Terms to Remember

- Front
- Back
- Push
- Pop

A stack is a data structure that uses "LIFO" (Last in, First out). Chances are you've encountered staack before, if you've ever meed up while writing
a paper and had to undo your error. To understand stacks we can visualize them as a plate of pancakes. 
The "Front" of the stack would be the first pancake that was made, or the first item of data that was entered. 
The following data will then enter behind, essentially "covering" the data before it. 
When data is added to the stack, thius is called a "Push". When data is removed from the stack, this is called a "Pop" and is taken from the most recent data entered,
or the "Back" of the stack.
