# Stacks

### Important Terms to Remember

- Front
- Back
- Push
- Pop

Have you ever messed up while writing a paper? Chances are you've used the undo button before.
The undo button uses what's known as the Stack data structure. The stack uses what's called Last in, First out (LIFO).

We can visualize a stack like a plate of pancakes. The "Front" of the stack would be the first pancake that was made, or the first
item of data that was entered. The following data will then enter behind, essentially "covering" the data before it. 
When data is added to the stack, thius is called a "Push". When data is removed from the stack, this is called a "Pop" and is taken from the most recent data entered,
or the "Back" of the stack.
